0	These results suggest that the C1772T polymorphism in @GENE$ is not involved in progression or metastasis of @DISEASE$.	1
1	In our setting, @DISEASE$ among alcoholic individuals seems to be independent of the presence of mutations C282Y, H63D and S65C in the @GENE$ gene.	1
2	MPO genotype GG is associated with @DISEASE$ in patients with hereditary @GENE$.	1
3	These three studies do not provide consistent evidence supporting the hypothesis that @GENE$ mutations are associated with an increased risk of @DISEASE$ and with the development of arteriosclerosis.	1
4	Our prospective findings suggest that individuals carrying the @GENE$ C282Y mutation may be at increased risk of @DISEASE$.	1
5	We conclude that  homozygosity for the G1514-->A mutation is exclusively responsible for the adult form of @DISEASE$ in this family, and that the A619-->G substitution is not a deleterious mutation but rather a common @GENE$ polymorphism.	1
6	The data suggest that the @GENE$ gene or a linked locus significantly modulates the risk for @DISEASE$.	1
7	The novel gene @GENE$ may be related with the infiltration and proliferation of @DISEASE$.	1
8	Our findings suggest that the genetic variants of the @GENE$ but not the TIM-3 gene contribute to @DISEASE$ susceptibility in this African-American population.	1
9	In conclusion, the M416V polymorphism of @GENE$ gene is not associated with insulin resistance in @DISEASE$.	1
10	We found no evidence that mutation in @GENE$,GNGT1,or RGS9 gene is a cause of @DISEASE$.	1
11	These results suggest that the @GENE$ null genotype may be associated with increased risk of @DISEASE$.	1
12	These findings suggest that the GSTA1 and @GENE$ polymorphisms are associated with @DISEASE$ susceptibility, especially among smokers.	1
13	These findings suggest that individual susceptibility to @DISEASE$ may be modulated by GSTM1, @GENE$ and NAT2 polymorphisms.	1
